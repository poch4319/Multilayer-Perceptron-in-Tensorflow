This is an implementation of a multi-layer perceptron, which can learn to classify
the Iris flower data set (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
with (depending on the random split) up to 100% accuracy. The program is written in tensorflow.
To run the program, run:
```
python main.py
```
